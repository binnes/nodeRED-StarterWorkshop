# Welcome to the Node-RED Starter Workshop

This workshop will introduce you to Node-RED to enable you to rapidly create feature rich applications with minimal coding.

## What you will learn

In this workshop you will learn:

- How to deploy Node-RED on the IBM Cloud, on your local computer and on a small device, such as a Raspberry Pi
- How to create applications
- Features of the programming environment
- How to save and share applications
- Introduction to some of the key 'nodes', which are the building blocks used when creating applications

The workshop is split into 3 parts:

## Part 1 - Installing Node-RED

In this section you will learn how to install and setup Node-RED in a number of different environments.

## Part 2 - Your first applications and how Node-RED works

In this section you will create your first application, but also learn how Node-RED applications work.  You will learn about the programming environment and see how to debug an application.

## Part 3 - Key nodes available in Node-RED

In this section you will learn about some of the key nodes available in Node-RED and how they can be used to create an application.
